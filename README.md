# Diabetes Disease Prediction Model

This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting the presence of diabetes based on a dataset that includes features such as age, glucose level, blood pressure, and other health-related factors.

## Project Overview

The project involves building a Random Forest Classifier to predict whether a person has diabetes or not based on several health parameters. The model uses a dataset and splits it into training and testing data, trains a Random Forest model, evaluates its performance, and saves the trained model to a file.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `pickle`

You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
